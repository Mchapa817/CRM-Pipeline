# CRM-Pipeline
# Status
This project is currently within the data collection stages and therefore does not have a final visualization or recommendations. However, I encourage anyone interested in gaining insight into my approach to new projects to review the outline Iâ€™ve set up for the library initiative. It offers a clear view of my planning process, showcasing how I develop and structure ideas before diving into execution.
